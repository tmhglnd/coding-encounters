# Coding Encounters

A collective effort that maps out creative coding encounters in the real world. Submit your marker for a location where you encountered a cool event, venue, workshop, meetup or anything else related to live coding.

Add tags to categorize the various markers.

Artists can use the map to connect with local communities, venues and such in place they visit. Newcomers can use the map to search for places where meetups are held.
